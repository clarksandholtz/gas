# gas

Still coming up with why exactly this is called `gas`. Mainly wanted something short and easy to type that started with 'g'. Words like git, add, and stage were on the mind when naming. Also open to a rename.

## To-Do's

[ ] - Figure out how to get ctl + return key to work
[ ] - Make pages scrollable
[ ] - Stage/unstage by chunk
[ ] - Stage/unstage by line
[ ] - Hoist `Legend` config to a global state manager (maybe also could be host the single instance of `userInput`)
[ ] - Maybe persist wip commit messages
[ ] - Stage/unstage all shortcut
